All the books I read in 2016
===
Well, all the _prose_ books at least. I got through a fair few comics as well, but as that's a different (though not totally unrelated) medium I don't count them here. I'm working from memory here, so if I give short time to the earlier entries it's due to my age...

1: Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said by Philip K. Dick
---
ISTR this started with what would ordinarilly be a decent paranoid high concept and then took a typically PKD reality-bending turn. I wasn't as engaged by it as by his best works (the previous one I read was A Scanner Darkly, a true masterpiece), but you shouldn't take that to be damning-with-faint-praise; it is still interesting, atmospheric and has some chillingly original moments.

2: Pond by Claire-Louise Bennett
---
While I don't remember a lot of detail from this, I think it's more because the short stories (some very short indeed) have such similar themes and settings they have sort of blurred together in my memory. This isn't a criticism, though - they are very well written. An author I will be keeping a look out for.

3: Hotel by Joanna Walsh
---
The best entry yet in the Object, Objects series, this one combines the examination of a specific topic (Hotels) with something more personal as the author's relationship breaks down. Some great insights and excellent writing, Joanna Walsh is another author I will be looking for more to read from.

4: "Rommel?" "Gunner who?" by Spike Milligan
---
I started reading Milligan's excellent war memoirs the previous year after finding a bunch in my local second hand bookshop; your mileage will vary according to whether you like his sense of humour, but I have been finding them brilliant, very funny, often poignant and even informative.

5: Augustus by John Williams
---
The last of the three big JW novels I have gotten to, and yet again a big contrast. I have seen it written that you would not guess they had the same author if you did not know, and while I see where that is coming from I think you could; this has themes and ideas very much in common with Stoner at least, especially towards the end with its mix of triumph and tragedy. The epistolary format (one of two books in this style I read this year) works very well not only for getting across political machinations but also character. A great companion piece to the Claudius novels.

6: Concepts of Modern Mathematics by Ian Stewart
---
Another second-hand-bookshop find, this is a broad introduction to modern mathematical concepts (albeit from the 1970s), and an early work by the now well-known Ian Stewart. A lot of it was reinforcing things I already knew, though I admit it occasionally went over my head as well.

7: Emergence: from chaos to order by John H. Holland
---
I have to admit, I don't remember this well at all. ISTR it was largely the author proposing an approach to analysing emergent properties and it didn't grab me in the way I expect of a popular science book however convincing his arguments were.

8: I AM ERROR by Nathan Altice
---
One of the best entries in the Platform Studies series so far, and having never owned an NES (or even played with one as a child) I am not coming at this from a position of nostalgia - this is a well-informed, thorough, fascinating and entertaining study and history of the game platform. The best of these books always make me think how fateful the decisions I make as a software engineer might be in terms of ultimately affecting the business and those working for it, and I find that's an important take-away.

9: Denglisch for Better Knowers by Adam Fletcher and Paul Hawkins
---
A gift from a colleague after I transferred to Berlin and started learning German, this is an entertaining bilingual book about some of the quirks of the German language (and by extension, culture). I do like to hedgehog myself on occasion.

10: The Garden Party and other stories by Katherine Mansfield
---
I have to admit only a couple of individual stories stuck in my mind at all, though I do seem to recall enjoying this at the time.

11: SPQR by Mary Beard
---
Excellent work from a reliably good educator on classical matters. People often like to claim how differently people thought historically to how they do today, but I am often unconvinced and this brought ancient Romans to relatable life very well for me. I vividly recall reading this while on a plane arriving in England on the morning of the EU referendum result, and there was a saddening paragraph on the Roman electorate's distrust of vested interests. If only the modern electorate could be so discerning.

12: Lady Susan, The Watsons, Sanditon by Jane Austen
---
Lady Susan is the second epistolary work I read this year, a witty early novella about the machinations of the widowed title character who is manipulative, deceitful, self-serving and yet remarkably likable; she was brilliantly brough to life by Kate Beckinsale in the movie Love and Friendship last year (the fact that I read it in the same year is pure coincidence, I had no idea there was an adapatation coming). The other two works here are unfinished fragments. The Watsons felt polished but quite downbeat, whereas Sanditon felt more like an early draft and I had problems following the characters at moments; there was something to it though, and it could well have been a classic if Austen had lived to complete it.

13: Reality: A Very Short Introduction by Jan Westerhoff
---
A good overview of the subject, which after all is the purpose of these books, but I didn't feel like I learned a lot from it.
